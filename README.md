# Langton's Ant Simulation
This was one of my first projects in JavaScript. I wanted to create a simulation that would run in the browser and render on a canvas element. I chose Langton's Ant because it was a simple set of rules that would create a complex pattern. This was a fun project to work on and I learned a lot about JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas element. 

## Overview
Langton's Ant follows a set of simple rules which create a path that, despite its randomness, forms emergent order. The simulation runs within a browser and renders on a canvas element, displaying the movement of the ant as it follows its rules on a grid of cells, changing colors and directions based on the current cell's color.

## Features
Full browser rendering using native HTML5 Canvas.
Dynamic grid setup based on browser window size.
Simple rule logic for Langton's Ant behavior.
Color toggling for grid cells based on ant movement.
Basic direction handling to navigate the grid.
